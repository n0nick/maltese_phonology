# Maltese Phonology

This will become my paper on *some topic* (TBD) in Maltese
Phonology for the [0627-2166 Advanced Course in Phonology](http://www2.tau.ac.il/yedion/syllabus.asp?year=2011&course=0627216601) seminar in my Linguistics BA.

For now it is just a place to keep track of the changes in my `.tex` & `.bib` files.
